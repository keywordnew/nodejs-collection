# The Node.js Collection Team
A place for [the Node.js Collection](https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection) to organize the technical editing process for articles submitted to the publication.

## Purpose of Node.js  Collection publication
The Node.js Collection is a [Medium](https://medium.com/) publication which serves as a channel for the community to broadcast to a wide audience its views related to Node.js and its ecosystem. This may include:

- Summaries of incubated projects or technical decisions made
- Working project initiatives
- Use cases and success stories
- Industry insights and best practices around Node.js and development trends (see topic areas below)
- Reports on Node.js and JavaScript events (these events must have a code of conduct to be considered)
- Other topics will certainly be considered, but it should be something of interest to the Node.js community

## Quality
We are looking for posts that inform, teach, experiment, and generally enrich our community. There's no hard and fast rule of what an article should or feel like; Node.js Collection articles should be as diverse as the community itself. Ideally, contributions should encourage readers to explore new ideas, dig deeper into old ones, and to inspire readers to experiment and tinker. Articles can cover any number of topics such as:

- Serverless/Cloud
- Containers
- Community
- Best Practices (How To)
- Embedded/IoT
- AI/Mobile
- More (Essentially news from the Foundation and potentially more editorial style content about the future of Node.js Core) - see Google Cloud Platform’s More section as an example [here](https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com).

If you're passionate about something not listed above, please don't hesitate to submit your idea for consideration.

## Guidelines/General Tips of Submissions

- Posts from members and community members must be vendor-neutral, though they may mention vendors involved in specific project deployments if this serves the purpose of educating readers.
- Posts about hosting of an in-person event or speaking at an event, or other indications of meaningful participation in the community, are allowed, but again shouldn’t feel like an advertisement for your services or company.
- Your post must be your original content, but can be published on the Node.js Foundation Medium publication, if you received permission from the editors of the website to do so.
- All content should have a byline (preferably by a company engineer) and be published with Creative Commons with Attribution, so you’re welcome to republish on your blog.
- The most interesting posts are ones that teach or explain how to do something in a way maybe others haven’t thought of. Good blog posts show hurdles that were encountered and explain how they were overcome (not that everything is rainbows and unicorns).
- A few posts that have performed well on the Node.js Foundation Medium page include Walmart Strives to be an Online Retailer with Node.js (use case); Node.js Transitions to LTS (news); The Progress of Node.js Post io.js and Node.js merger (progress update).
- When showing upstreaming of a patch fixing an issue for others, link back to the Github issue so readers can follow along.
- We don’t avoid critical commentary or broad issues but approach them with sensitivity, professionalism, and tact in a way that is beneficial and positive for the community.
- Node.js Foundation Medium posts should be no longer than 1,000 words and no shorter than 300 words.
- Diagrams or photos are strongly encouraged.

## How to submit for consideration

- Members of the Node.js Collection Technical Review Team and Node.js ProjectPR team will review your submission in a timely manner and provide the green light to draft the entire article or provide feedback or direction.
- If you are submitting an article or presentation that already exists, please send it in its entirety with a note on the expressed permission to publish from the owner of the content.
